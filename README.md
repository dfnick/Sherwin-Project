# Sherwin-Project
long running data analysis project
encompass Python, SPSS, R, Numerical analysis, and statistics. 

An up to date product and shipment database.
I'll be starting with a simple SPSS data set and go from there. I hope to tie Python in as much as I can during this process so I'll be using a lot of the tools from these sites. http://spsstools.net/en/python-index/  http://www.spss-tutorials.com/python/

R and the other processes will come into play as soon as I get the beginning steps up.
